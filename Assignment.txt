Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?

Solution :  Python can be used in many domains, including web development, scientific computing, data science, artificial intelligence, and more.

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?

Solution:   In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to them.

            To create a variable, you just assign it a value and then start using it. There is no specific syntax for declaring variables in Python.

            You can create a variable by simply assigning it a value, as follows:

            x = 10

            y = "Hello"

            z = True

            You can also declare multiple variables in a single line, as follows:

            x, y, z = 10, "Hello", True'''

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?

Solution :  There are various ways to take input from the user in Python.

Solution : A string is a sequence of characters. We can declare string in Python by using quotes.

Q27. How can we access the string using its index?

Solution : The index of a string is the position of a character within the string.

	     To access a string using its index, we can use square brackets. 

	     For example, if we have a string "Hello", we can access its characters using their indices:

Hello[0] // "H"

Q32. What is escape sequence?

Solution :An escape sequence is a sequence of characters that does not represent itself when used inside a character or string literal, but is translated to a combination of characters 		    that may be difficult or impossible to represent otherwise. An escape sequence is composed of a backslash ('\') character followed by one or more characters.

Q33. How can you print the below string?

'iNeuron's Big Data Course'

Solution : You can print the string by enclosing it in single quotation marks.

Q34. What is a list in Python?

Solution : In Python, a list is a collection of items that can be accessed by indexing. Lists are mutable, meaning they can be changed in-place.

Q35. How can you create a list in Python?

Solution : There are a number of ways to create lists in Python. The most common is to use the list() function to create an empty list.

	     You can also create lists using the [] notation. For example:

	     my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c']

	     You can also create lists using the list() constructor. For example:

           my_list = list(('a', 'b', 'c'))

Q36. How can we access the elements in a list?

Solution : There are a few ways to access the elements in a list. The most common way is to use the indexing operator ([ ]). This operator requires one argument, which is the index of the 	     element that you want to access. Another way to access the elements in a list is to use the for loop.

	     example: my_list=['a','b','c','d']
		        my_list[2]
			  output: c

		    lst[3]="BIG"
		    lst.append(temp)
		    print(lst)

Q40. What is a tuple? How is it different from list?
Solution : A tuple is a sequence of immutable Python objects. Tuples are sequences, just like lists. The differences between tuples and lists are, the tuples cannot be changed unlike lists 	     and tuples use parentheses, whereas lists use square brackets.


Q41. How can you create a tuple in Python?
Solution :A tuple is created by placing items, separated by commas, inside parentheses.

	    example : tuple2 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 )
			  tuple1 = 'physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000

Q42. Create a tuple and try to add your name in the tuple. Are you able to do it? Support your answer with reason.
Solution :A tuple is an immutable data type, which means that you cannot change the values in a tuple once it is created. Therefore, you are not able to add your name to an existing tuple.


Q43. Can two tuple be appended. If yes, write a code for it. If not, why?
Solution :Yes, two tuples can be appended.

	    tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)
	    tuple2 = (4, 5, 6)

	    tuple1 + tuple2


Q44. Take a tuple as an input and print the count of elements in it.
Solution :
	   tuple1=eval(input("Enter a tuple:"))
	   count=0
	   for i in tuple1:
           count=count+1
         print("The number of elements in the tuple is:",count)
or
	   user_input = tuple(input("Enter a tuple: "))
         print("Count of elements in the tuple: ", len(user_input))

Q45. What are sets in Python?
Solution :Sets are data structures that hold an unordered collection of unique items. You can create a set by using the set() function.


Q46. How can you create a set?
Solution :There are many ways to create a set in python. One way is to use the set() function.

Q47. Create a set and add "iNeuron" in your set.
Solution :my_set={'great','learning','platform','is'}
	    my_set.add('iNeuron')
	    print(my_set)

Q48. Try to add multiple values using add() function.
Solution :my_set={'great','learning','platform','is'}
	    my_set.add('iNeuron','shashank','sir')
	    print(my_set)

	    Gives TypeError: set.add() takes exactly one argument (3 given)


Q49. How is update() different from add()?
Solution :Update adds an element to the set if it does not already exist. Add will add an element to the set no matter what.

Q50. What is clear() in sets?
Solution :clear() is a method that removes all elements from a set.

Q51. What is frozen set?
Solution :Frozen set is an immutable set. Immutable means it cannot be changed after it is created.

Q52. How is frozen set different from set?
Solution :Frozen set is an immutable object that cannot be changed. Set is a mutable object that can be changed.


Q53. What is union() in sets? Explain via code.
Solution :The union() method returns a new set with all the items from both sets.

	    Example:

		set1 = {"a", "b" , "c"}
		set2 = {1, 2, 3}

		set3 = set1.union(set2)

		print(set3)

		#Output: {'a', 'c', 'b', 1, 2, 3}

Q54. What is intersection() in sets? Explain via code.
Solution :The intersection() method returns a new set with elements that are common to all sets.

For example:

		 s1 = {1, 2, 3}
		 s2 = {2, 3, 4}
		 s3 = {3, 4, 5}
		 s1.intersection(s2, s3)
		 {3}


Q55. What is dictionary in Python?
Solution :A dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key is associated with a value, which can be a number, string, list, or another dictionary. Dictionaries are used 	    to store data in a structured way.
